Hello, my name is Abhijit Nayak

ðŸ¤– I am in my final semester of my Data Science Master's Degree at Indiana University Bloomington, USA. Being a skilled data scientist, I am deeply passionate in the field of Machine Leanring and NLP, and have recently started exploring Computer Vision and MLOps. Besides my core data science skillset, I do posses some data engineering hands on proficiency as well and have exposure to other programming languages like Rust, C++, JavaScript, Julia. In addition to this, I help businesses and organizations address their pain areas by applying AI which in turn generates revenue or saves costs.

ðŸ’¬ As my graduation date is nearing, I am looking for full-time employment opportunities in the field of Data Science and AI. I have over 4 years of industry experience as Data Scientist and more than a year of experience as a Researcher in Computer Vision and NLP.

ðŸ’» Please explore my Github repositories to learn more about my work, and feel free to reach out if you would like to discuss a project or collaboration.
